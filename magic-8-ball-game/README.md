### Magic 8 Ball Game

![Magic 8 Ball Screenshot](images/eightball-screenshot.png)

The Magic 8 Ball is a fun, interactive web app built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. Inspired by the classic fortune-telling toy, it provides random answers to user-submitted questions — complete with smooth animations and realistic shading.

This project demonstrates DOM manipulation, responsive UI design, and the use of modern CSS techniques like clamp() and aspect-ratio.

- Interactive Input – Type a question and receive a random yes/no-style answer.
- Dynamic Answer Reveal – The number “8” transforms into the answer to your question.
- Polished Visual Design – Layered gradients and shadows mimic the look of a real 8-ball.
- Fully Responsive – Scales beautifully across mobile, tablet, and desktop screens.
